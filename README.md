# Practical-Malware-Analysis

This repository contains my personal notes and lab results pertaining to the text "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honiq.
The collection of materials found here is in no way a replacement for the wealth of knowledge contained in the pages of "Practical Malware Analysis".
